## Built-in Validators & Using HTML5 Validation

Which Validators do ship with Angular? 

Check out the Validators class: https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators - these are all built-in validators, though that are the methods which actually get executed (and which you later can add when using the reactive approach).

For the template-driven approach, you need the directives. You can find out their names, by searching for "validator" in the official docs: https://angular.io/api?type=directive - everything marked with "D" is a directive and can be added to your template.

Additionally, you might also want to enable HTML5 validation (by default, Angular disables it). You can do so by adding the ngNativeValidate  to a control in your template.
